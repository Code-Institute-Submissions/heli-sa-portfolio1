            <h2>Why Saaremaa?</h2>
            <p> It is island of Estonia in the Baltic sea. It's more or less as big as Luxembourg and is sparsely populated with it's circa 31.000 inhabitants.</p>

                Silence and space- it is not crowded.
                Entrepreneur-friendly- less beaurocratic.
                Access to forest and the sea- "Everyman's right".
                Debt-free living - Interesting Culture -Folkmusic , a singing nation , sauna's and spa's, Nordic influences.
                Debt-free living - affordable farmsteads.
                Natural building opportunities- space for experimentation.
                A slightly warmer climate and more hours of sunshine - Island micro climate.
                Story and myth - A land created by giants and influenced by viking culture.
                Saaremaa, along with the other islands of West Estonia, is a member of UNESCO's ''Human and Biosphere'' program.
            </p>  
            <p> The Capital city of Saaremaa is Kuressaare what is most likely the place visitors will find themselves based. With almost half of the island’s population living here, it’s fair to say that the town is the hub of the island. Good news then that Kuressaare has an easy going charm to it. Throughout the town centre you’ll mostly come across old fashioned wooden houses and plenty of small boutique shops and cafes to while away your day.</p> 
            <p>Over 40% of Saaremaa is covered with forests.</p>
            <p>Saaremaa has more spas than anywhere else in Estonia.</p> 
            <p>On the island 98% is Ethnic Estonian.</p>

        <img src="#" alt="Kuressaare castle">
        <p>    During the Russian occupation was the island almost cut off from the world and mainland a between 1946- 1989.  Saaremaa is Estonia’s largest of the country’s 2,222 islands and lies in the country’s west in the Baltic Sea. Much of Saaremaa’s history mirrors that of mainland Estonia, except that after Second World War it was basically isolated, during the Russian occupation almost cutting it off from the world and mainland a between 1946 and 1989.
            In old Scandinavian sources, Saaremaa is called Eysysla and in the Icelandic Sagas Eysýsla, meaning “the district (land) of the island”. The island is called Saaremaa in Estonian, and in Finnish Saarenmaa—literally “isle land” or “island land”.</p>
        <p>
            The island was occupied in 1227 by the Brothers of the Sword, who founded a bishopric there. It came under Danish (1559), Swedish (1645), and Russian (1721) rule before becoming part of Estonia in 1918.
            Russian forces flew bombing raids on Berlin from their military base on Saaremaa Island.
            Saaremaa largest town, the impossibly quaint Kuressaare. Found on the island’s south coast, Kuressaare is most likely the place visitors will find themselves based. With almost half of the island’s population living here, it’s fair to say that the town is the hub of the island. Good news then that Kuressaare has an easy going charm to it. Throughout the town centre you’ll mostly come across old fashioned wooden houses and plenty of small boutique shops and cafes to while away your day.
            addIf there’s a highlight of Kuressaare it has to be the town’s castle. Kuressaare Castle, once known as Arensburg Castle, is a large moated castle found by the sea shore. The castle cuts a very distinct star shaped figure on the map with its angular fortified walls surrounded by a deep moat. Outside the moat are also some very elegant manor buildings that are more recent additions and there are some spectacular views from the surrounding park. Unfortunately, I managed to delete ALL of my photos from Kuressaare so sadly the castle photos below are not my own.
            The castle’s history is tied with that of Kuressaare itself, which is first mentioned in writing in 1154. It was during this time that the crusading Livonian Brothers of the Sword arrived on Saaremaa and settled. The castle was built sometime during the 13th and 14th centuries, originally of wood, aiding their efforts to spread Christianity to the locals. The castle as with the island of Saaremaa passed hands many times over the centuries between big regional players like the Danes, Swedes and Russians.</p>

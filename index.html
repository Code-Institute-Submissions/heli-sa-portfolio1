      <h2>Some interesting facts</h2>
      <p>Scarce: Traffic lights (none), noise (it's unbelievably quiet at nights, if you ever visit—take a walk at night and enjoy, no-mountains (as flat as can be), fishermen (used to be plenty, but not enough fish to catch anymore!), public transport, McDonald's (none, and people oppose having one).
      <br><br>The Capital city of Saaremaa is Kuressaare, what is most likely the place visitors will find themselves based. With almost half of the island’s population living here, it’s fair to say that the town is the hub of the island. <br><br>Good news then that Kuressaare has an easy going charm to it. Throughout the town centre you’ll mostly come across old fashioned wooden houses and plenty of small boutique shops and cafes to while away your day.
      Over 40% of Saaremaa is covered with forests.
      Saaremaa has more spas than anywhere else in Estonia.</p>

    <h2>History</h2>
    <p>  Saaremaa is Estonia’s largest of the country’s 2,222 islands and lies in the country’s west in the Baltic Sea. Much of Saaremaa’s history mirrors that of mainland Estonia, except that after Second World War it was basically isolated, during the Russian occupation almost cutting it off from the world and mainland a between 1946 and 1989.
         <br><br>The island is called Saaremaa in Estonian, and in Finnish Saarenmaa—literally “isle land” or “island land”.     The island was occupied in 1227 by the Brothers of the Sword, who founded a bishopric there. It came under Danish (1559), Swedish (1645), and Russian (1721) rule before becoming part of Estonia in 1918.
         Russian forces flew bombing raids on Berlin from their military base on Saaremaa Island.

    <br><br>The castle’s history is tied with that of Kuressaare itself, which is first mentioned in writing in 1154. The castle was built sometime during the 13th and 14th centuries, originally of wood, aiding their efforts to spread Christianity to the locals. The castle as with the island of Saaremaa passed hands many times over the centuries between big regional players like the Danes, Swedes and Russians.
